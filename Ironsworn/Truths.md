## The Old World

The savage clans called the Skulde invaded the kingdoms of the Old World. Our armies fell. Most were killed or taken into slavery. Those who escaped set sail aboard anything that would float. After an arduous months-long voyage, the survivors made landfall upon the Ironlands.

## Iron

The imposing hills and mountains of the Ironlands are rich in iron ore. Most prized of all is the star-forged black iron.

## Legacies

Before the Ironlanders, before even the firstborn, another people lived here. Their ancient ruins are found throughout the Ironlands.

## Communities
```iron-vault-truth

```
We live in communities called circles. These are settlements ranging in size from a steading with a few families to a village of several hundred. Some circles belong to nomadic folk. Some powerful circles might include a cluster of settlements. We trade (and sometimes feud) with other circles.

## Leaders

Leadership is as varied as the people. Some communities are governed by the head of a powerful family. Or, they have a council of elders who make decisions and settle disputes. In others, the priests hold sway. For some, it is duels in the circle that decide.

## Defense

The wardens are our soldiers, guards, and militia. They serve their communities by standing sentry, patrolling surrounding lands, and organizing defenses in times of crisis. Most have strong ties to their community. Others, called free wardens, are wandering mercenaries who hire on to serve a community or protect caravans.

## Mysticism

Magic is rare and dangerous, but those few who wield the power are truly gifted.

## Religion
```iron-vault-truth

```
The people honor old gods and new. In this harsh land, a prayer is a simple but powerful comfort.

## Firstborn
```iron-vault-truth
truth:classic/firstborn
inserted
```
The firstborn have passed into legend. Some say the remnants of the old tribes still dwell in deep forests or high mountains. Most believe they were never anything more than myth.

## Beasts
```iron-vault-truth

```
Monstrous beasts stalk the wild areas of the Ironlands.

## Horrors

The dead do not rest in the Ironlands. At night we light torches, scatter salt, and post sentries at the gate. It is not enough. They are coming.
